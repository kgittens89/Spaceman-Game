## Project Description 

A browser-based Spaceman two-player game. A user, player 1, will input a word to be guessed by their opponent, player 2, at the start of the game. The word is represented by blank spaces for each letter on the page, which are revealed when guessed. For wrong guesses, a part of the spaceship is revealed. If player 2 guesses the word before the spaceship is completely built, they win. If not, player 1 wins.

## User Stories

### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want a browser-based interface, so that I can play the game
- As a user, I would like a simple description for the game, so I know the rules
- As a user, I want the game to recognize my input guesses and display the correct letters, so that it is automative
- As a user, I want the game to reach a win/lose state, so that I know the outcome of the game and can play again


### Stretch Goals

#### Bronze

- As a user, I want the game to tell me when it is my turn, so there is no confusion
- As a user, I would like to know the letters that I have already guessed, so that I don't repeat them.

#### Silver

- As a user, I would like to know how many guesses I have left before the ship is completely built, so that I am aware
- As a user, I would like to be able to input my name instead of "Player 1", so that the game feels more personalized

#### Gold
- As a user, I would like to know which letters are available to be picked, so that I am aware
