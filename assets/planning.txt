Spaceman Game 

Planning
- The game page starts, popping up a 'how to play' modal a set time after page load. 
    - the how to play moday will list the instructions for the game. 
    - At the bottom will be a button to close the modal. 
    
- The first player will put a word into the word-to-guess input section.
    - That word is seperated by letters, and that amount of blank spaces will pop up in the guessing-board section 
- The secondPlayer will then have a chance to guess the letters using the letter-input field
    - input a single letter then hit the submit button
- When that letter is inputed, if the letter-input matches any of the missing letters of the word-to-guess, that letter is revealed on it's blank space. 
    - If the letter-input doesn't match any letters from word-to-guess, a part o fthe spaceship image will reveal itself.
        - The missed letter will also be added to the aside section. 
- The round ends when secondPlayer guesses all of the letters
    - Or when the ship is completely built. 






Stretch goals
- Currently, the image will have small spaces between them. Try to make it so after a set time, the images all come together to make one image. 
- Add a reset button to start the game over.
