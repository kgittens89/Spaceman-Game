Spaceman Game 

Planning
- The game page starts, popping up a 'how to play' modal a set time after page load. 
    - the how to play moday will list the instructions for the game. 
    - At the bottom will be a button to close the modal. 
- The first player will put a word into the word-to-guess input section.
    - That word is seperated by letters, that number of letters is how many blank spaces will pop up in the guessing-board section 
    




Stretch goals
- Currently, the image will have small spaces between them. Try to make it so after a set time, the images all come together to make one image.
